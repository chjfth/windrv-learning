When doing cl /c bulkrwr.c, I have to pass option -DWINNT, otherwise

	EVENT_CONTROL_CODE_ENABLE_PROVIDER

will not be defined(appears in evntrace.h but hidden by and #ifdef check).

Why can "ENABLE_EVENT_TRACING=1" in 'sources' determine .tmh file generating?
It seems that .tmh is generated by running tracewpp.exe, but buildchk_win7_amd64.log does not contain tracewpp command line.
